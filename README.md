# LSE DATA ANALYTICS - INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT 2

Collaborating with the NHS, I used Python to analyze data on service utilization, staff capacity, and public opinion via Twitter. I refined business questions, conducted exploratory data analysis, and presented insights 
through visualizations and a detailed report to support NHS decision-making.
## CONTEXT
In this NHS-focused project, I leveraged Python's data analysis ecosystem to address real-world healthcare challenges. Utilizing Pandas and Numpy within Jupyter Notebook, I performed comprehensive data cleaning and wrangling tasks. 
The project involved web scraping to gather additional relevant data. I created insightful visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify trends. 
 The analysis encompassed service utilization patterns, staff capacity issues, and public sentiment derived from social media. 
By applying these technical skills, I delivered actionable insights to support NHS decision-making, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques within the healthcare context.
