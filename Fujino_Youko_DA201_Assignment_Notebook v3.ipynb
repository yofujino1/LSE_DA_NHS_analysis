    "This Jupyter Notebook is a template you can use to complete the Course 2 assignment: Diagnostic Analysis using Python. \n",
    "Keep in mind the following points: \n",
    "- Using this template as your working document is optional, it is **not required** to use this template to complete the assignment. \n",
    "- The intention of the template is to provide suggestions regarding the structure and workflow that is expected and it follows the assignment activites throughout the course.\n",
    "- Refer to the guidance in the Assignment Activity pages for specific details. \n",
    "- The markup and comments in this template identify the key elements you need to complete before submitting the assignment.\n",
    "- Make this notebook your own by adding comments, cells, and content to reflect your analytical journey. You can add links, screenshots, or images to support your analysis, refine or clarify the questions, and change the workflow to suit your process. Important elements include:\n",
    "    - code comments\n",
    "    - Markdown cells with your observations, interpretation, and notes in anticipation of the technical report and business presentation.\n",
    "- All code output and visualisations should be functional and visible in the submitted Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "- If you decide to use this template for your assignment, make a copy of the notebook and save it using the assignment naming convention: **LastName_FirstName_DA201_Assignment_Notebook.ipynb**.\n",
    "- Be sure to save frequent snapshots of your Jupyter Notebook to ensure that you can recover work if required.\n",
